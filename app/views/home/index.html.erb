  <h1 class="p-2 font-serif font-bold text-2xl ">About this app</h1>
  It is our fist app which we use as a sandbox and testbed to establish communication,
  git workflow and to solve basic technical problems.
<br>
<br>
  It was created by:

  <p class="mt-2 w-fit bg-indigo-200 text-sm mr-2 px-1 py-0.5">rails new test -d postgresql</p>
  
  <p class="mt-2">
   <span class="bg-gray-200">-d postrgresql</span> is to set postgresql as a database.
   </p>

  Then we added couple dependicies with <span class="bg-gray-200 px-1">yarn add</span>: <br>
  CSS framework <a href="https://tailwindcss.com" class="underline">Tailwind</a>
  and file watching library <a href="https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar" class="underline"> Chokidar </a>
  for live-reloading in development.

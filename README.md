# Welcome to our test repository!!!

## First Steps
1. clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/r-rails/test.git` to your computer
2. install ruby 3.0.4 (rbenv or rvm is recomended)
3. run `bundle` in the cloned folder to install all dependencies
4. run `bin/dev`, that is a better `rails s`, since it includes tailwind reloading
